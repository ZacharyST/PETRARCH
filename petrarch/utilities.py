def coref_replace(event_dict, key):
    """
    Function to replace pronouns with the referenced noun phrase. Iterates
    over each sentence in a news story and pulls coreference information
    from the applicable sentence, even if it is from another sentence. Also
    keeps track of any changes in indexes made by replacing pronouns, i.e.,
    the reference is longer than the reference so the tree index changes for
    future references. Filters coreferences on various dimensions to ensure
    only "good" coreferences are replaced. The default behavior is to do
    no replacement rather than a bad replacement. The function does not
    return a value, instead the event_dict is updated with the new parse tree
    containing the coref information.

    Parameters
    ----------

    event_dict: Dictionary.
                    Dictionary of sentence information, such as produced by
                    utilities.parse_sents().

    key: String.
            ID of the event or news story being processed.
