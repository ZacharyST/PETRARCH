Python Engine for Text Resolution And Related Coding Hierarchy (PETRARCH)
========

Repository for the development of the Python-language successor to the [TABARI](http://eventdata.psu.edu/software.dir/tabari.html)
event-data coding program. You can find the documentation for PETRARCH [here](http://eventdata.readthedocs.org/). You can read more about event data [here](http://eventdata.psu.edu/).

### Current Usage

The program options are rather fluid at this point in time. If you would like
to use the program, or just see how some of the output looks, simple usage is:

    python petrarch.py parse -i SENTENCE_FILE -o output.txt
