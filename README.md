PETRARCH
========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eventdata/PETRARCH.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eventdata/PETRARCH)

Repository for the development of the Python-language successor to the TABARI
event-data coding program. 

###Current Usage

The program options are rather fluid at this point in time. If you would like
to use the program, or just see how some of the output looks, simple usage is:

    python petrarch.py parse -i SENTENCE_FILE -o output.txt
